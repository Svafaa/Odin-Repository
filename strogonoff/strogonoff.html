<h1>Strogonoff</h1>
<img src="images/strf.jpg">
<p>A popular Russian food dish that is typically made from thinly sliced beef taken from a tender cut of meat, which is quickly sautéed in butter with sliced mushrooms and onions. The sautéed mixture is then combined with a sour cream sauce and is most often served over a rice pilaf or noodles. Although beef is the most common meat used to make Stroganov, which is then referred to as Beef Stroganov, other meats can also be used to make this dish such as chicken.</p>
<p>Named for the Russian family who created the original recipe, the food dish became known as Stroganoff by the French when it was made in France. When Stroganov was first created in Russian kitchens, it was made with cubes of beef. Eventually, the recipe used slices of beef and thereafter many variations of this food dish were created which changed the ingredients slightly from the original recipe. Mustard and tomato paste have been considered as optional ingredients while beef, sour cream, onions, and butter have remained the traditional ingredients in the recipe. Other terms used to describe Stroganov include Strogonoff and Estrogonofe which are names originating in South America.</p>
