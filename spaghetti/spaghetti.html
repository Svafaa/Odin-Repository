    <p>spaghetti, thin, straight, cylindrical pasta of Italian origin, the most popular of all pastas eaten today.</p>
    <p>Noodles made of wheat and eggs were known in the Mediterranean world in antiquity, but the pasta we know as spaghetti—which takes its name from the Italian spaghetto, “little cord”—was probably introduced to Sicily by the island’s Arab conquerors in the 8th century. The name was first recorded in 1874, however, suggesting that spaghetti may have remained a regional dish until shortly after the unification of Italy. Spaghetti was likely eaten with butter and cheese until about that time too; although the tomato was introduced to Italy as part of the Columbian Exchange, it was not widely eaten until the 19th century.</p>
